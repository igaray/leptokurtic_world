> "How much will additional data (under such a probability distribution) help increase the stability of the observed mean". The purpose is not entirely statistical: it can equally mean: "How much will adding an additional security into my portfolio allocation increase its stability?" - Nassim Taleb

> There's a connection between heavy-tailed distributions and non-ergodicity. Actually, they're often two mathematical models of the same observation. Imagine drawing instances from a distribution whose variance doesn't exist and measuring the sample variance. As you keep drawing instances, the sample variance will increase. You, as the observer, may conclude that the "true" variance is infinite. or you may conclude that the true variance is a function of time, not stationary, and that the asymptotic distribution doesn't exist (or at least that that's a reasonable model for the situation). You may conclude the system is not ergodic. - Ole Peters
